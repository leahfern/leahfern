### Hola 👋

I'm Leah! After an extended journey in the travel industry, I am boarding my next flight as a Web Developer. My team members describe me as collaborative, innovative, and committed. I love to learn and improve daily. I am also passionate about giving back and fill up my "free" time by leading several volunteer initiatives.
